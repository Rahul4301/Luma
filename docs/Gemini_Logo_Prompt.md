# Gemini Prompt: Luma Logo

Use the prompt below in **Google Gemini** (AI Studio or Bard) to generate logo concepts for Luma. You can ask for multiple variations (e.g. “Generate 4 variations: one abstract glow, one minimal window, one aperture/beam, one combined symbol — abstract shapes only, no letters”) or for refinements (e.g. “Softer blue-slate accent” or “More minimal, single shape only”).

## Copy-paste prompt for Gemini

```
Create a logo for a macOS app named "Luma."

**What the app is:** Luma is a browser that blends the chrome (tabs, address bar) with the current webpage’s background color, and has a right-side AI panel (Cmd+E) that understands the page (URL, title, visible text, selection). So: browsing + the page’s “light” (luminance) + context-aware AI.

**Logo requirements:**
- **Concept:** The logo should evoke (1) light / luminance — “Luma” means light; the app uses the page’s light to adapt the UI; (2) a browser or window — a frame or view onto content; (3) clarity and calm — soft, professional, not playful or loud.
- **Form:** A single, iconic abstract shape — no letters or letterforms. Works at 16×16 (favicon) and at larger sizes. Prefer one of these directions (or combine subtly):
  - Abstract glow or soft radiance (e.g. a minimal sun, lens flare, or gradient glow).
  - A minimal window/frame or “view” shape that suggests a browser.
  - A simple aperture, beam, or lens form that suggests light.
- **Style:** Clean, minimal, modern. Rounded or soft edges where it fits. No letters, no wordmarks, no generic globes, chat bubbles, or robot imagery.
- **Color:** Works on both light and dark backgrounds. Primary suggestion: soft blue-slate accent (roughly #6B8FA8 or similar) on dark gray or transparent, or a single-color version (white on dark / dark on light) for versatility.
- **Output:** Provide a logo mark only: an abstract shape, no letters and no wordmark. The mark should feel native to a premium macOS browser with an AI assistant — calm, intelligent, and tied to “light” and “seeing the page.”

## Optional follow-up prompts

- **More minimal:** “Simplify the logo to a single shape: only one primary form (e.g. just the glow, or just the window, or just the aperture — no letters). No secondary details.”
- **Favicon-first:** “Optimize this for a 16×16 favicon: bold silhouette, no thin lines, recognizable at tiny size.”
- **Dark-mode variant:** “Give me a version that reads clearly on dark background (e.g. white or light blue-slate on transparent).”
- **Tie to MVP:** “The app’s UI uses dark gray with warm undertones and blue-slate (#6B8FA8) for focus states. Make the logo use that blue-slate as the only accent so it matches the in-app panel.”
